# Release Notes

## 1.10.0 / 2014-11-10 

The following changes are required if you are upgrading from the previous version:

- **Users:**
  - No changes required
- **Plugin Developers:** 
  - Review `addChainableNoop` notes below.
- **Core Contributors:** 
  - Refresh `node_modules` folder for updated dependencies. 

### Noop Function for Terminating Assertion Properties

The following assertions can now also be used in the function-call form:

* ok
* true
* false
* null
* undefined
* exist
* empty
* arguments
* Arguments

The above list of assertions are property getters that assert immediately on 
access. Because of that, they were written to be used by terminating the assertion 
chain with a property access.

```js
expect(true).to.be.true;
foo.should.be.ok;
```

This syntax is definitely aesthetically pleasing but, if you are linting your 
test code, your linter will complain with an error something like "Expected an 
assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." Since the linter 
doesn't know about the property getter it assumes this line has no side-effects, 
and throws a warning in case you made a mistake.

Squelching these errors is not a good solution as test code is getting to be 
just as important as, if not more than, production code. Catching syntactical 
errors in tests using static analysis is a great tool to help make sure that your 
tests are well-defined and free of typos.

A better option was to provide a function-call form for these assertions so that 
the code's intent is more clear and the linters stop complaining about something 
looking off. This form is added in addition to the existing property access form 
and does not impact existing test code.

```js
expect(true).to.be.true();
foo.should.be.ok();
```

These forms can also be mixed in any way, these are all functionally identical:

```js
expect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false();
expect(true).to.be.true().and.not.false;
expect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false;
```

#### Plugin Authors

If you would like to provide this function-call form for your terminating assertion 
properties, there is a new function to register these types of asserts. Instead 
of using `addProperty` to register terminating assertions, simply use `addChainableNoop` 
instead; the arguments to both are identical. The latter will make the assertion 
available in both the attribute and function-call forms and should have no impact 
on existing users of your plugin.

## 1.9.1 / 2014-03-19 

The following changes are required if you are upgrading from the previous version:

- **Users:**
  - Migrate configuration options to new interface. (see notes)
- **Plugin Developers:** 
  - No changes required
- **Core Contributors:** 
  - Refresh `node_modules` folder for updated dependencies. 

### Configuration

There have been requests for changes and additions to the configuration mechanisms
and their impact in the Chai architecture. As such, we have decoupled the 
configuration from the `Assertion` constructor. This not only allows for centralized
configuration, but will allow us to shift the responsibility from the `Assertion` 
constructor to the `assert` interface in future releases.

These changes have been implemented in a non-breaking way, but a depretiation
warning will be presented to users until they migrate. The old config method will 
be removed in either `v1.11.0` or `v2.0.0`, whichever comes first.

#### Quick Migration

```js
// change this:
chai.Assertion.includeStack = true;
chai.Assertion.showDiff = false;

// ... to this:
chai.config.includeStack = true;
chai.config.showDiff = false;
```

#### All Config Options

##### config.includeStack

- **@param** _{Boolean}_
- **@default** `false`

User configurable property, influences whether stack trace is included in 
Assertion error message. Default of `false` suppresses stack trace in the error 
message.

##### config.showDiff

- **@param** _{Boolean}_
- **@default** `true`

User configurable property, influences whether or not the `showDiff` flag 
should be included in the thrown AssertionErrors. `false` will always be `false`; 
`true` will be true when the assertion has requested a diff be shown.

##### config.truncateThreshold **(NEW)**

- **@param** _{Number}_
- **@default** `40`

User configurable property, sets length threshold for actual and expected values 
in assertion errors. If this threshold is exceeded, the value is truncated.

Set it to zero if you want to disable truncating altogether.

```js
chai.config.truncateThreshold = 0; // disable truncating
```
