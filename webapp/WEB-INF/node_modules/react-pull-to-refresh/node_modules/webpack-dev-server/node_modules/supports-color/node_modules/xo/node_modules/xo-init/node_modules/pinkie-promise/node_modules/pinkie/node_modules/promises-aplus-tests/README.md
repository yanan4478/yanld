# Promises/A+ Compliance Test Suite

This suite tests compliance of a promise implementation with the [Promises/A+ specification][].

[Promises/A+ specification]: https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec

Passing the tests in this repo means that you have a Promises/A+ compliant implementation of the `then()` method, and you can display the Promises/A+ logo in your README. You can also [send a pull request](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec) to have your implementation listed on the [implementations page](https://promisesaplus.com/implementations).

## How To Run

The tests can run in either a Node.js environment or, if you set things up correctly, in the browser.

### Adapters

In order to test your promise library, you must expose a very minimal adapter interface. These are written as Node.js
