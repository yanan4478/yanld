# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Attention: node-glob users!

The API has changed dramatically between 2.x and 3.x. This library is
now 100% JavaScript, and the integer flags have been replaced with an
options object.

Also, there's an event emitter class, proper tests, and all the other
things you've come to expect from node modules.

And best of all, no compilation!

## Usage

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Features

Please see the [minimatch
documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more details.

Supports these glob features:

* Brace Expansion
* Extended glob matching
* "Globstar" `**` matching

See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

## glob(pattern, [options], cb)

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function}
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform an asynchronous glob search.

## glob.sync(pattern, [options])

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform a synchronous glob search.

## Class: glob.Glob

Create a Glob object by instanting the `glob.Glob` class.

```javascript
var Glob = require("glob").Glob
var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
```

It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
immediately.

### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])

* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
be immediately available on the `g.found` member.

### Properties

* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
* `options` The options object passed in.
* `error` The error encountered.  When an error is encountered, the
  glob object is in an undefined state, and should be discarded.
* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search
  performed.
* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
  values:
  * `false` - Path does not exist
  * `true` - Path exists
  * `1` - Path exists, and is not a directory
  * `2` - Path exists, and is a directory
  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory,
