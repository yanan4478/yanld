  sinon.match.{any, same, typeOf, instanceOf, has, hasOwn, defined, truthy,
  falsy} as well as typeOf shortcuts for boolean, number, string, object,

  originating in an external window as "object" instead of "function".

  stub.yieldsOn, stub.yieldsToOn

  calls to the original spy.
* Minor bug fixes and docs cleanup.

== 1.3.1 / 2012-01-04
* Fix bug in core sinon: isNode was used for both a variable and a function,
  causing load errors and lots of bugs. Should have never left the door.

== 1.3.0 / 2012-01-01
* Support using bare functions as fake server response handlers (< 1.3.0
  required URL and/or method matcher too)
* Log some internal errors to sinon.log (defaults to noop). Set sinon.log
  to your logging utility of choice for better feedback when.

  the backend server (Tim Ruffles)
* Decide Date.now support at fake-time. Makes it possible to load something that
  polyfills Date.now after Sinon loaded and still have Date.now on fake Dates.
* Mirror properties on replaced function properties
* New methods: spy.yield(), spy.yieldTo(), spy.callArg() and spy.callArgWith()
  can be used to invoke callbacks passed to spies (while avoiding the mock-like
  upfront yields() and friends). invokeCallback is available as an alias for
  yield for people working with strict mode. (Maximilian Antoni)
* New properties: spy.firstCall, spy.secondCall, spy.thirdCall and spy.lastCall.
  (Maximilian Antoni)
* New method: stub.returnsArg(), causes stub to return one of its arguments.
  (Gavin Huang)
* Stubs now work for inherited methods. This was previously prohibited to avoid
  stubbing not-yet-implemented methods. (Felix Geisendörfer)
* server.respond() can now accept the same arguments as server.respondWith() for
  quick-and-dirty respondWith+respond. (Gavin Huang)
* Format objects with buster-format in the default bundle. Default to
  util.inspect on node unless buster-format is available (not a hard dependency,
  more like a 'preference').

* Bug fix: Make sure XHRs can complete even if onreadystatechange handler fails
* Bug fix: Mirror entire Date.prototype, including toUTCString when faking
* Bug fix: Default this object to global in exposed asserts
* Bug fix: sinon.test: use try/finally instead of catch and throw - preserves
  stack traces (Kevin Turner)
* Bug fix: Fake `setTimeout` now returns ids greater than 0. (Domenic Denicola)
* Bug fix: NPM install warning (Felix Geisendörfer)
* Bug fix: Fake timers no longer swallows exceptions (Felix Geisendörfer)
* Bug fix: Properly expose all needed asserts for node
* Bug
