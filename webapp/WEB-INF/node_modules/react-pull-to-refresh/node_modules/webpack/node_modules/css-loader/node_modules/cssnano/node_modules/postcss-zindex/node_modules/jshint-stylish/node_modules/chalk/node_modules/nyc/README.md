```shell
nyc npm test
```

a code coverage tool built on [istanbul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul)
that works for applications that spawn subprocesses.

## Instrumenting Your Code

Simply run your tests with `nyc`, and it will collect coverage information for
each process and store it in `.nyc_output`.

```shell
nyc npm test
```

you can pass a list of Istanbul reporters that you'd like to run:

```shell
nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text-lcov npm test
```

If you're so inclined, you can simply add nyc to the test stanza in your package.json:

```json
{
  "script": {
    "test": "nyc tap ./test/*.js"
  }
}
```

## Checking Coverage

nyc exposes istanbul's check-coverage tool. After running your tests with nyc,
simply run:

```shell
nyc check-coverage --lines 95 --functions 95 --branches 95
```

This feature makes it easy to fail your tests if coverage drops below a given threshold.

## Running Reports

Once you've run your tests with nyc, simply run:

```bash
nyc report
```

To view your coverage report:

```shell
