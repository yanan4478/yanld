## Example

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(true).to.be.a.boolean().and.to.not.equal(false);
expect('this string').to.only.include(['this', 'string']);
```

## Acknowledgments

**code** was created as a direct rewrite of the powerful [**chai**](http://chaijs.com) assertions
library. This virtual fork was created for a few reasons. First, **chai** mixed usage of methods and
properties creates a problematic environment in which it is too easy to forget a method `()` and result
in an assertion that is never executed (and therefor passes incorrectly). This observation was noted by
the [**must**](https://github.com/moll/js-must) author.

The second reason is that similar to [**lab**](https://github.com/hapijs/lab), our test runner, we wanted
an assertion library that is small, simple, and intuitive - without plugins, extensions, or the overhead
of having to support testing in the browser. **code** provides much of the same functionality is about
300 lines of code that are trivial to read in a few minutes.

And last, we wanted to experiment with some new features that allow deeper integration between the test
runner and assertions library. The first of which are two methods exported (and used by **lab**) for getting
the total assertions count (which is a measure of the tests comprehensiveness), and by verifying that every
assertion created (e.g. every `expect()` call) is also executed. This will alert when a statement like
`expect(5).to.be.a.string` is not allowed to remain unnoticed (and fail to throw due to the missing `()`).

Like **lab**, the goal is to keep this module small and simple. If you need extensibility or other
functionality, we recommend looking at the many other excellent assertions libraries available.

## Usage

### Grammar

**code** supports usage of connecting words to make assertions more readable. The inclusion of these
grammar elements has no impact over the assertion outcome and are used for human readability only.
Every method or property of the assertion object returned by `expect()` returns `this` which allows
chaining addition assertions or grammar words.

The supported words are:
- `a`
- `an`
- `and`
- `at`
- `be`
- `have`
- `in`
- `to`

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(10).to.be.above(5);
expect('abc').to.be.a.string();
expect([1, 2]).to.be.an.array();
expect(20).to.be.at.least(20);
expect('abc').to.have.length(3);
expect('abc').to.be.a.string().and.contain(['a', 'b']);
expect(6).to.be.in.range(5, 6);
```

### Flags

The following words toggle a status flag for the current assertion:
- `deep` - performs a deep comparison instead of simple equality (`===`). Required when trying to compare
  objects to an identical copy that is not the same reference. Used by `equal()` and `include()`.
- `not` - inverses the expected result of any assertion.
- `once` - requires that inclusion matches appear only once in the provided value. Used by `include()`.
- `only` - requires that only the provided elements appear in the provided value. Used by `include()`.
- `part` - allows a partial match when asserting inclusion. Used by `include()`.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(10).to.not.be.above(20);
expect([{ a: 1 }]).to.deep.include({ a: 1 });
expect([1, 1, 2]).to.only.include([1, 2]);
expect([1, 2]).to.once.include([1, 2]);
expect([1, 2, 3]).to.part.include([1, 4]);
```

Note that including the same flag twice toggles the last value set. This is especially important when
chaining multiple assertions in a single statement (e.g. when using the `and` grammar word).

### `expect(value, [prefix])`

Generates an assertion object where:
- `value` - the reference value on which to apply the assertion rules.
- `prefix` - an optional string used as an error message prefix.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(10, 'Age').to.be.above(5);
```

#### Types

Asserts that the reference value is of a certain type.

##### `arguments()`

Asserts that the reference value is an `arguments` object.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

var func = function () { return arguments; };
expect(func()).to.be.arguments();
```

##### `array()`

Asserts that the reference value is an `Array`.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect([1, 2]).to.be.an.array();
```

##### `boolean()`

Asserts that the reference value is a boolean.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(true).to.be.a.boolean();
```

##### `buffer()`

Asserts that the reference value is a `Buffer`.

```js
var Code = require('code');
var expect = Code.expect;

expect(new Buffer(''
