# through2

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/through2.png?downloads&downloadRank)](https://nodei.co/npm/through2/)

**A tiny wrapper around Node streams.Transform (Streams2) to avoid explicit subclassing noise**

Inspired by [Dominic Tarr](https://github.com/dominictarr)'s [through](https://github.com/dominictarr/through) in that it's so much easier to make a stream out of a function than it is to set up the prototype chain properly: `through(function (chunk) { ... })`.

Note: A **Streams3** version of through2
